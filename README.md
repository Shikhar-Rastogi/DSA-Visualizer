# Algorithm Visualizer (C++ Console-Based)

This is a **C++ console-based application** that visually demonstrates the working of several fundamental **sorting**, **graph**, and **array-based algorithms** in a step-by-step manner. It's designed to help learners understand how algorithms function internally by showing each significant step.
